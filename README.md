## üìã Project Description

In this project, we developed an image captioning tool that:

- **Analyzes images and generates automatic captions** using the [BLIP](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) model from Hugging Face Transformers.  
- **Provides an intuitive graphical user interface** powered by the [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) library.  
- **Demonstrates real-world business applications**, such as content management, automated tagging, and enhanced accessibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**: The main programming language for development.  
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: A library for implementing deep learning models.  
- **BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining)**: The model used for image captioning.  
- **Gradio**: A framework for building user-friendly machine learning interfaces.
